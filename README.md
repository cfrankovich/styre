# Styre 
Styre is the danish word for "manage" and this program does just that. Styre is a command line tool used to manage ideas, projects, todo lists, and anything else the user needs. Styre is aimed towards developers in need of a simple/minimalistic time manager. 

## Installation
To begin the install, make `Install.sh` an executable by running
```
$ chmod +x Install.sh
```

After this is done simply run
```
$ ./Install.sh
```
and the rest should be taken care of by the shell script.
## Documentation
Styre is still in development.
